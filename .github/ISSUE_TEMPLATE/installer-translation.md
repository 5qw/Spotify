## üìù Features translation

Before you start translating, you need to know how your language is called in powershell, for this you need Windows with this default language, enter the following command in the powershell terminal :

```ps1
$PSUICulture.Remove(2)
```

- Translation language powershell: *Enter here what you received in powershell*

Then you can start translating lines, they start after the equal sign.

It is important that you do not need to translate before the equal sign, these are variables.

Also, if you come across characters {0}, {1} or file names, then just skip them.

Good luck to you.
